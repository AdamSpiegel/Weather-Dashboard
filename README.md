# Weather-Dashboard ☀️🌨️🌥️🌩️🌤️

## Project Criteria
   *  Develop a weather dashboard which has an ability to search by city.

   * When that search occurs, the systems uses APIs to render current and future conditions for that particular city, and that city is added to the search history.
   
   * When viewing current weather conditions for that city, the user is able to view the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

   * When viewing the UV index, then the user is presented with a color inidicating the weather.

   * A 5 day forcecast should also be displayed at the bottom of the page, displaying the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity

   * Finally, when a city is clicked on in the search history, then the user is again presented with that citie's future and current conditions.


## Action Items 

    1) I began the layout for this weather dashboard, by developing my HTML page after the repository was established.

    2) Within the HTML, I developed a title/header and developed my links and script tags including Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Momemnt.

    3) Utilizing bootstrap and modifying for style, the zip code search bar was developed first, with an added button for the user.  A card was also established through bootstrap to display the current date and time.

    4) 

    5) 

    **Items in Progress/Troubleshooting 
    1) Correct JavasScript Functionility - Still need to work on understanding how this links together
    2) API calls - While understanding the correct concept of the fetch/get function, I need to understand how this syntax is written.
